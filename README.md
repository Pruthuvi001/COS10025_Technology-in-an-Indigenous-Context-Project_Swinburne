Aims
This unit aims to provide students with an opportunity to work on a project that will deepen
their understanding of the plurality and diversity Indigenous knowledge systems, worldviews,
standpoints, and culture in relation to STEM technologies. The project will have a focus on
emerging technologies and the respectful blending of Western and Indigenous knowledge
systems to enhance project outcomes. Students will work collaboratively in teams and will
have a staff member as a ‘facilitator’ whilst working on the project.
Unit Learning Outcomes

context taking into consideration and acknowledging Indigenous histories,
worldviews, standpoints, and cultures.
4. Function as an effective team member using project management tools and
demonstrating professionalism and ethical behaviour.
5. Communicate within teams using appropriate verbal, visual, written and technological
approaches
6. Appreciate emerging technologies in a local, global and sustainable context.

c) Submission Requirements
Assignments and other assessments are generally submitted online through the Canvas
assessment submission system which integrates with the Turnitin plagiarism checking
service.
Please ensure you keep a copy of all assessments that are submitted.
In cases where a hard copy submission is required an Assessment Cover Sheet must
be submitted with your assignment. The standard Assessment Cover Sheet is available
from the Current Students web site.

An Assessment Cover Sheet must be submitted with your assignment. The standard
Assessment Cover Sheet is available from the Current Students web site.
d) Extensions and Late Submission
Late Submissions - Unless an extension has been approved, late submissions will result
in a penalty. You will be penalised 10% of the assessment’s worth for each calendar day
the task is late, up to a maximum of 5 days. After 5 calendar days, a zero result will be
recorded.
e) Referencing
To avoid plagiarism, you are required to provide a reference whenever you include
information from other sources in your work. Further details regarding plagiarism are
available in Section C of this document.
Referencing conventions required for this unit are: APA or Harvard
Helpful information on referencing can be found at
http://www.swinburne.edu.au/library/referencing/
f) Individual Assessments
An individual assessment must be submitted in accordance with the expectation of
different assessment to be submitted by due date. If the work is part of a teamwork
(project) where an individual need to work on his project brief/research report/final
report, an individual team member should have continued communication with the team
members and attend all classes, workshops, and team meetings. In the event of longer-
term illness or other serious problems involving a member of group, it is responsibility of
an individual to immediately notify the Unit convenor or relevant tutor/facilitator.
g) Teamwork Guidelines
COS10025_Unit Outline_Semester_2 2023 Page 6 of 8
A team assignment is the collective responsibility of the entire team, and if one member
is temporarily unable to contribute, the team should be able to reallocate responsibilities
to keep to schedule. In the event of longer-term illness or other serious problems
involving a member of the team, it is the responsibility of the other members to notify
immediately the Unit Convenor or relevant facilitator.
Team submissions must be submitted with an Assignment Cover Sheet, signed by all
members of the team.
All team members must be satisfied that the work has been correctly submitted. Any
penalties for late submission will generally apply to all team members, not just the
person who submitted.
Required Textbook(s)
No textbook is required for this unit.
Recommended Reading Materials
All recommended reading material are available on Canvass
PART C: FURTHER INFORMATION
Student Charter
Please familiarise yourself with Swinburne’s Student Charter. The charter describes what students
can reasonably expect from Swinburne in order to enjoy a quality learning experience. As students
contribute to their own learning experience to that of their fellow students, the charter also defines the
University's expectations of students.
Student behaviour and wellbeing
Swinburne has a range of policies and procedures that govern how students are expected to conduct
themselves throughout the course of their relationship with the University. These include policies on
expected standards of behaviour and conduct which cover interaction with fellow students, staff and
the wider University community, in addition to following the health and safety requirements in the
course of their studies and whilst using University facilities.
All students are expected to familiarise themselves with University regulations, policies and
procedures and have an obligation to abide by the expected guidelines. Any student found to be in
breach may be subject to relevant disciplinary processes. Some examples of relevant expected
behaviours are:
• Not engaging in student misconduct
• Ensuring compliance with the University’s Anti-Discrimination, Bullying and Violence and
Sexual Harassment requirements
• Complying with all Swinburne occupational health and safety requirements, including
following emergency and evacuation procedures and following instructions given by
staff/wardens or emergency response.
In teaching areas, it is expected that students conduct themselves in a manner that is professional
and not disruptive to others. In all Swinburne laboratories, there are specific safety procedures which
must be followed, such as wearing appropriate footwear and safety equipment, not acting in a manner
which is dangerous or disruptive (e.g. playing computer games), and not bringing in food or drink.
For further information on any of the below topics, refer to Swinburne’s
Current Students web page http://www.swinburne.edu.au/student/.

Canvas
You should regularly access the Swinburne learning management system, Canvas, which is available
via the Current Students webpage or https://swinburne.instructure.com/ Canvas is updated regularly
with important unit information and communications.
Communication
All communication will be via your Swinburne email address. If you access your email through a
provider other than Swinburne, then it is your responsibility to ensure that your Swinburne email is
redirected to your private email address.
Plagiarism
Plagiarism is the action or practice of taking and submitting or presenting the thoughts, writings or
other work of someone else as though it is your own work. Plagiarism includes any of the following,
without full and appropriate acknowledgment to the original source(s):
• The use of the whole or part of a computer program written by another person;
• the use, in essays or other assessable work, of the whole or part of a written work from any
source including but not limited to a book, journal, newspaper article, set of lecture notes,
current or past student’s work, any other person’s work, a website or database;
• The paraphrasing of another’s work;
• The use of musical composition, audio, visual, graphic and photographic models,
• The use of realia that is objects, artefacts, costumes, models and the like.
• Plagiarism includes the submission of assessments that have been developed by another
person or service through contract, tender or online writing services.
• Plagiarism also includes the preparation or production and submission or presentation of
assignments or other work in conjunction with another person or other people when that work
should be your own independent work. This remains plagiarism whether or not it is with the
knowledge or consent of the other person or people. It should be noted that Swinburne
encourages its students to talk to staff, fellow students and other people who may be able to
contribute to a student’s academic work but that where independent assignment is required,
submitted or presented work must be the student’s own.
Enabling plagiarism contributes to plagiarism and therefore will be treated as a form of plagiarism by
the University. Enabling plagiarism means allowing or otherwise assisting another student to copy or
otherwise plagiarise work by, for example, allowing access to a draft or completed assignment or
other work.
Swinburne University use the Turnitin system that helps check for improper citations or potential
plagiarism in assignments submitted electronically via Canvas. Your Unit Convenor will provide further
details.
The penalties for plagiarism can be severe, ranging from a zero grade for an assessment task through
to expulsion from the unit and, in the extreme, exclusion from Swinburne. Consequently, you need to
avoid plagiarism by providing a reference whenever you include information from other sources in
your work.
Student support
You should talk to your Unit Convenor or Student Services for information on academic support
services available for Swinburne students.
Special consideration
If your studies have been adversely affected due to serious and unavoidable circumstances outside of
your control (e.g. severe illness or unavoidable obligation), you may be able to apply for special
consideration (SPC).
Applications for Special Consideration will be submitted via the SPC online tool normally no later than
5.00pm on the third working day after the submission/sitting date for the relevant assessment
component.

Accessibility needs
Sometimes students with a disability, a mental health or medical condition or significant carer
responsibilities require reasonable adjustments to enable full access to and participation in education.
Your needs can be addressed by Swinburne's Accessibility Services by negotiating and distributing
an 'Education Access Plan'. The plan makes recommendations to university teaching and
examination staff. You must notify Accessibility Services of your disability or condition within one week
after the commencement of your unit to allow the University to make reasonable adjustments.
Review of marks
An independent marker reviews all fail grades for major assessment tasks. In addition, a review of
assessment is undertaken if your final result is between 45 and 49 or within 2 marks of any grade
threshold.
If you are not satisfied with the result of an assessment, you can ask the Unit Convenor to review the
result. Your request must be made in writing within 10 working days of receiving the result. The Unit
Convenor will review your result to determine if your result is appropriate.
If you are dissatisfied with the outcomes of the review, you can lodge a formal complaint.
Feedback, complaints and suggestions
In the first instance, you may discuss any issues with your Unit Convenor. If you are dissatisfied with
the outcome of the discussions with the Unit Convenor or would prefer not to deal with your Unit
Convenor, then you can complete a feedback form.
Advocacy
Should you require assistance with any academic issues, University statutes, regulations, policies and
procedures, you are advised to seek advice from an Independent Advocacy Officer at Swinburne
Student Life (previously Swinburne Student Amenities Association (SSAA).
